A practice React Native app based on this assignment: https://github.com/woltapp/react-native-assignment

This app was bootstrapped with `react-native init` using the [React Native Community Typscript template](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-template-typescript).

For getting Android to work with localhost network requests make sure to run `adb reverse tcp:8080 tcp:8080` (replace `8080` with whatever port your API is running on). See: https://stackoverflow.com/a/43277765
